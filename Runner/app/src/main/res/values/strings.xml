    <string name="help_text">This app allows you to track your runs and view statistics about your runs.
        \n\nTo begin a run, go to the Home page and click on the run button. You can then start running and the app will automatically track your route and statistics about your run. Once you are finished, click on the stop button and the app will ask you if you\'d like to save your run. If you click on yes, the app will save your run. If you click on no, your run information will be deleted.
        \n\nOnce you have taken at least one run, all your runs will be available on the My Runs page. You can scroll through and click on any of them to view the run in full screen. From there, you can share the run with your friends by clicking on the share button at the top right of the screen.
        \n\nTo view statistics about all your runs combined, go to the Statistics page. This page will give you various statistics about your runs, and will assist you with determining any progress you make.
        \n\nYou can also set weekly targets for yourself on the Weekly Goals page. You will be able to set a target for total distance, total duration and average speed. The app will automatically check if you met your week\'s targets at midnight on monday morning, and will keep track of the last date that you met your target, as well as how many targets you have met in a row. You can change your targets for the current week at any time (make sure to click on the save icon at the top right of the screen to save your changes).
        \n\nIf you\'d like to change the unit that distances and speeds are displayed in (kilometres or miles), go to the Settings page and choose your preferred unit there. The app will then display all of your statistics using your preferred unit.
